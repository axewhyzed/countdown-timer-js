# Countdown Timer JS

This is a simple countdown timer created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It shows the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds until a specified date and time.

## Getting Started
To run this project, download the source code and open the index.html file in a web browser.

## Usage
The timer is pre-set to countdown to May 23, 2023, at 5:00 PM, but this can be changed by uncommenting the input field in the HTML and adding a date and time to the input.
